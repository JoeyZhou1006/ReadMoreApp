# ReadMoreApp
How to run this app:
1. git clone project in a directory

2. run "npm install" in root directory in command line 

3. save code that i have sent to the audience in a file called "config.js", and then save this file in src directory of the app, more specifically put it in the "readmoreapp/src/" directory, so the app can talk to the firebase instance for authentication

4. after everything is set, run "npm start" in command line to explore this app

Technologies used:
React.js + firebase

Things to note:
Recently, i started to explore react.js, as it is an emerging and powerful technology, before developing the development of this app, i only had some basic knowledge of it, however with the development went along, i learnt more and more techniques, like react hooks, react router, navigation bar, some state management
